# tRPC

Using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) as playground.

> tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

> As TypeScript and static typing increasingly becomes a best practice in web development, API contracts present a major pain point. We need better ways to **statically type** our API endpoints and **share those types** between our client and server (or server-to-server). We set out to build a simple library for building typesafe APIs that leverages the full power of modern TypeScript.

## Like GraphQL

Similar to GraphQL, tRPC makes a distinction between query and mutation procedures.

The way a procedure works on the server doesn't change much between a query and a mutation.

## Usage

Run server and client by running `yarn dev`.

Or run them separately by running server `yarn dev:server` and after that running client `yarn dev:client`.
